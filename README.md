# NOTT-300_Acidic_Gases
Input files and analysis scripts for Nott-300/Gas adsorption study

This repository contains the input files and analysis materials used in the computational investigation of acidic gas adsorption in the NOTT-300 framework.

## Repository structure

### DFT_outs
This directory includes the optimized geometries of the NOTT-300 cluster model obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The geometries correspond to the pristine (gas-free) structure as well as the structures after adsorption of individual gas molecules, namely H₂S, CO₂, N₂, O₂, and CH₄.

### GCMC_MD_inputs
This directory contains the input files used for Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations performed with the RASPA2 software package. These inputs define the simulation conditions employed to evaluate gas adsorption and diffusion behavior in the NOTT-300 framework.
